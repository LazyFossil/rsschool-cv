### 🍃 About me:

Hi all!!! I am 21 years old, worked at IKEA as a computer operator. I also worked part-time as a rescue sailor. After several jobs, i decided to look for something more promising and learned about Front-end from friends. This work, after some practice, really attracted me. I like to learn something new, although sometimes it is difficult, but in this i see a great perspective for myself. I will try to gain as much necessary knowledge as possible to successfully pass this stage and become an experienced Front-end or Full-stack Developer.

### 💻 Code example:

**Will you make it?**<br>
You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is **50** miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about **25** miles per gallon. There are **2** gallons left.

Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.

Function should return **true** if it is possible and **false** if not.

```javascript
const zeroFuel = (distanceToPump, mpg, fuelLeft) => {
  const result = mpg * fuelLeft 
  if (result >= distanceToPump)  {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}

zeroFuel(50, 25, 2)
```
